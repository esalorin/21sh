# 21sh

Description

On to more serious things! With 21sh, you will write an implementation close to the loop “read, eval, print” of a shell. With the help of the Termcaps library, you will add a functional command line useful for the “read” part of your shell. Cursor movement, editing, history, multi-lines, etc. 21sh will be your first real interpreter. As such, this project will let you discover lexical, syntax and semantic analysis common to interpreters and compilers. With adapted data structure and processing, adding pipe (“|”) and redirect (“<”, “<<, “>>”, “>”) support will be easy!
